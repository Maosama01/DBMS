DBMS and OS Conceptual Tools
This repository contains a collection of interactive HTML tools designed to help students and developers visualize and understand core concepts in Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Operating Systems (OS), specifically focusing on data models, query execution, normalization, and deadlock management.

üöÄ Project Components
The project is structured into four main, self-contained HTML files, each focusing on a specific foundational concept:

File Name
Title / Concept

Description
Q2.html

Data Models & DBMS Architecture Explorer
An interactive visualization tool explaining the structure and differences between Core Data Models (Relational, Hierarchical, Network, Document) and comparing DBMS Architectures (Centralized vs. Client‚ÄìServer) with flow diagrams.

Q4.html

Database Normalization Assistant
A pedagogical tool to guide users through the process of database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF). Users can input attributes and functional dependencies to compute candidate keys and see the step-by-step decomposition process.

Q6.html

SQL Query Simulator
A browser-based simulator that allows users to execute SQL-like queries (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregate functions) against pre-defined sample data sets. It provides immediate visual results and helps demonstrate query execution logic.

Q8.html

Deadlock & Recovery Visualizer
A visualization and simulation tool focusing on concurrency control and resource management. It features a Process-Resource Graph for deadlock detection and simulates the Banker's Algorithm for safety checks, including steps for deadlock recovery (Process Termination and Resource Preemption).



üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Each file is a standalone HTML document containing all necessary structure, styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).
Clone or Download: Get the files onto your local machine.
Open in Browser: Open any of the .html files directly in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). No server is required.
Interact: Follow the on-screen instructions to input data (like attributes, FDs, or SQL queries) and execute the respective simulations and visualizations.
This suite of tools is ideal for practical learning, revision, and demonstrating complex computer science principles.
